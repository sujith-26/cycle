            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>A rental cycle company, also known as a bike rental service or bicycle hire company, is a business that provides bicycles for temporary use to individuals or groups. Here's an overview of what a rental cycle company typically offers:

                Services Provided by a Rental Cycle Company:
                Bicycle Rentals: The primary service offered by a rental cycle company is the rental of bicycles for short-term use. Customers can choose from various types of bikes, such as city bikes, mountain bikes, road bikes, hybrid bikes, and electric bikes (e-bikes), depending on their preferences and intended use.
                
                Flexible Rental Options: Rental cycle companies usually offer flexible rental options, allowing customers to rent bikes for a few hours, a full day, multiple days, or even longer durations. Some companies may also offer weekly or monthly rental plans for extended use.
                
                Helmet and Equipment Rentals: In addition to bicycles, rental cycle companies often provide safety equipment such as helmets, as well as optional accessories like bike locks, baskets, child seats, and panniers for carrying belongings.
                
                Guided Tours: Many rental cycle companies offer guided bike tours led by experienced local guides. These tours may include scenic routes, historical landmarks, cultural attractions, and insider tips about the area's best biking spots.
                
                Maintenance and Support: Rental cycle companies typically maintain their fleet of bicycles to ensure they are safe and in good working condition. They may offer on-site repairs, roadside assistance, or replacement bikes in case of mechanical issues or emergencies.
                
                Online Booking and Reservation: To streamline the rental process, many rental cycle companies provide online booking platforms where customers can browse available bikes, select rental durations, and make reservations in advance.
                
                Delivery and Pickup Services: Some rental cycle companies offer delivery and pickup services, allowing customers to have bikes delivered to their desired location and picked up at the end of the rental period for added convenience.
                
                Customer Support and Assistance: Rental cycle companies typically have knowledgeable staff who can assist customers with bike selection, route planning, safety guidelines, and any other inquiries or concerns they may have.
                
                Business Model:
                The business model of a rental cycle company involves generating revenue through rental fees charged to customers for bike usage. Additional revenue streams may include guided tour fees, equipment rentals, delivery charges, and merchandise sales (such as branded apparel or accessories).</p>
